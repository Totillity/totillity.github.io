Looking at previous languages I used, and the work that I've don already, I think that my language needs a lot of 
flexibility. I want my language to be able to target multiple other languages (such as Python, Javascript, and Lua).
At the very least, I'll need very flexible hash-maps (dictionaries in python and objects in javascript) which can 
have multiple behaviors. After all, each language I listed above treats them differently. 

Beyond that, my default language will probably pull from python-style significant indentation. It looks much nicer,
especially because it wastes less space on '{{' and '}}'. I will need to see how python parses, it, though, because I don't
know for the life of me.
